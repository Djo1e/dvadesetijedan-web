A pocket-sized piece of glass that can retrieve any piece of information at any time, talk to you, understand you, recognize faces, read fingerprints, record audio and video, and take high-resolution photographs. It is a flashlight, a compass, a navigation system, a notebook, a calendar, a travel planner, and a million other things.
